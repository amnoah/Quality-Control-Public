# Welcome!

Welcome to the public release of Quality Control. I don't know how much time I'm going to invest into this project, so
I figured I'd open source it in hopes that it may help others. A couple of checks have been removed at the request of
third parties in order to not kill them, but otherwise this is the full anticheat.

# Quality Control

Quality Control isn't a great anticheat, I'm not going to lie. What it does accomplish is catch basic cheats/exploits that
fail to follow various different guidelines. Use this as an example of some bad packets checks rather than running it...
especially because there are a bunch of console errors that I don't feel like fixing.

(I'm sorry for the switch statement abuse... they're my favorite part of Java)
